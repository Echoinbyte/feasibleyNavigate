# Feasibley Use the Web
A highly performant, beautiful, and dynamic heading navigation menu with virtualization for seamless browsing.

[Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/540246-feasibly-use-the-web)

## Overview
Feasibley Use the Web is a lightweight, customizable userscript that enhances web navigation by providing a floating, interactive menu of all headings (h1â€“h6) on a webpage. It uses virtualization for performance, ensuring smooth operation even on pages with numerous headings. The menu is draggable, collapsible, and supports filtering, keyboard navigation, and automatic updates when page content changes.

## Features
- Dynamic Heading Detection: Automatically detects and lists all h1â€“h6 headings on the page, assigning unique IDs if none exist.
- Virtualized Rendering: Efficiently renders only visible menu items, optimized for pages with many headings.
- Collapsible Interface: Toggle between expanded and collapsed states with a single click or keyboard shortcut (Alt+T).
- Drag-and-Drop Positioning: Move the menu anywhere on the screen, with position saved across sessions.
- Filterable Headings: Search headings using a text input (Alt+N to focus).
- Keyboard Navigation: Navigate headings with arrow keys, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, and select with Enter or Space (Alt+H to focus the list).
- Active Heading Highlighting: Highlights the current heading based on scroll position and provides visual feedback when navigating.
- Responsive Design: Adapts to page changes via MutationObserver, updating the menu when headings are added or removed.
- Customizable Styling: Modern, semi-transparent design with a customizable color scheme.
- Persistent State: Saves collapse state and menu position using localStorage.
- Accessibility: Includes ARIA attributes and keyboard-friendly navigation for improved usability.
  
## Installation
1. Install a userscript manager like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey.
2. Copy the provided userscript code into a new script in your userscript manager.
3. Save and enable the script. It will automatically run on all webpages (*://*/*).

## Usage
### Opening and Navigating
- The navigation menu appears as a floating panel in the top-right corner of the webpage.
- Toggle Menu: Click the âˆ’/ï¼‹ button or press Alt+T to collapse/expand the menu.
- Filter Headings: Click the search input or press Alt+N to focus it, then type to filter headings.
- Navigate Headings: Press Alt+H to focus the headings list, then use:
    - Arrow Up/Down: Move between headings.
    - Home/End: Jump to the first/last heading.
    - PageUp/PageDown: Move 5 headings up or down.
    - Enter/Space: Navigate to the selected heading with smooth scrolling and a brief highlight.
    - Escape: Return focus to the navigation panel or clear the filter.
    - Click Navigation: Click any heading in the menu to jump to it with a visual highlight.
      
### Dragging the Menu
- Click and drag the header (ðŸ§­ Feasibley Navigate) to reposition the menu.
- The position is saved and persists across page reloads.
  
### Automatic Updates
- The menu updates automatically when the page content changes (e.g., dynamic content loading).
- It tracks URL changes (e.g., hash navigation or history state changes) to refresh the heading list as needed.
  
## Configuration
- The script includes a CONFIG object for customization:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  debounceDelay: 750, // Delay for debouncing page updates (ms)
  virtualization: {
    itemHeight: 38, // Height of each menu item (px)
    buffer: 8, // Number of extra items rendered above/below the visible area
  },
  colors: {
    menuBackground: "rgba(30, 41, 59, 0.85)", // Menu background color
    menuBorder: "#475569", // Border color
    menuText: "#e2e8f0", // Primary text color
    menuTextSecondary: "#94a3b8", // Secondary text color
    menuHover: "rgba(51, 65, 85, 0.9)", // Hover background
    menuActive: "#1e293b", // Active heading background
    focusOutline: "#60a5fa", // Focus outline color
    shadow: "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)", // Shadow color
    accent: "#60a5fa", // Highlight color
    scrollbar: "#475569", // Scrollbar color
    scrollbarHover: "#64748b", // Scrollbar hover color
  },
};
```

Modify these values in the script to adjust the menu's appearance or behavior.

## Technical Details

- Performance: Uses virtualization to render only visible headings, reducing DOM overhead on pages with many headings.
- MutationObserver: Monitors the DOM for changes to headings, ensuring the menu stays up-to-date.
- IntersectionObserver: Tracks visible headings to highlight the active one based on scroll position.
- Debouncing: Limits update frequency to prevent performance issues during rapid DOM changes.
- Accessibility: Implements ARIA roles (navigation, menu, menuitem) and keyboard navigation for inclusivity.
- Storage: Uses localStorage to persist menu position and collapse state.
- Compatibility: Works on all webpages (*://*/*) with no external dependencies.
- 
## Limitations and TODOs

- Custom Selectors: Future versions may support custom heading selectors beyond h1â€“h6.
- Nested Numbering: Plans to add support for more complex heading numbering schemes.
- Custom Shortcuts: Additional keyboard shortcuts may be configurable in future updates.
- Edge Cases: May not handle dynamically generated IDs perfectly if pages use conflicting ID schemes.
  
## Troubleshooting
- Menu Not Appearing: Ensure the page has h1â€“h6 headings. If none exist, the menu will be empty.
- Position Reset: If the menu's position is off-screen, clear localStorage for feasible-nav-position or reload the page.
- Performance Issues: On very dynamic pages, increase debounceDelay in the CONFIG object to reduce updates.
- Conflicts: Disable other userscripts to check for interference with DOM manipulation or event listeners.
